# Ideas

I'm including summary research results here. Items such as EMR features, reporting requirements, etc.

## What's in an EMR Anyway?

*An electronic health record (EHR) contains patient health information, such as:*

- [ ] Administrative and billing data
- [ ] Patient demographics
- [ ] Progress notes
- [ ] Vital signs
- [ ] Medical histories
- [ ] Diagnoses
- [ ] Medications
- [ ] Immunization dates
- [ ] Allergies
- [ ] Radiology images
- [ ] Lab and test results
