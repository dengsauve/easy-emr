# Easy EMR
The open source Electronic Medical Record system. [Test site](https://emr.dennissauve.com)

## Mission
To create a truly open-sourced emr system utilizing a SaaS approach. 

## Feature Goals
- A clean, intuitive UI that allows medical professionals the ability to work quickly and with minimal training
- Unlimited patient attachments, such as images of xrays and other scans. (Believe it or not, some emr systems only allow 1 image per patient, and it's usually their profile picture.)
- Notifying patients by email of their appointments.
- The ability for the patient to log into the system and see their data.
- iOS application for medical professionals on the go. 
- iOS application for patients to view their information, and in the hope to someday partner with apple to be able to import Apple Health data for review by Doctors.


## Why?
I hear, time and again, from Physician's Assistants to Nurses, to Doctors and Administrative staff, that any current EMR software is terrible.

I want to change how medical staff views EMR systems. I want them to have tools they can trust and rely on. I want them to have tools they enjoy using. I want to give Doctors more face time with patients, and less screen time with the computer.

## How
By anticipating the needs of the medical field and using a web based SaaS approach, a dynamic, continuously developed EMR system can be created to meet the needs of a hospital and it's staff. More features may be added and developed by actively soliciting and critically reviewing feedback from the staff.

## Contributions
