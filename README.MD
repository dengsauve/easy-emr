# Easy EMR
The open source Electronic Medical Record system.

## Mission
To create a truly open-sourced emr system utilizing a SaaS approach. 

## Why?
I hear, time and again, from Physician's Assistants to Nurses, to Doctors and Administrative staff, that any current EMR software is terrible.

I want to change how medical staff views EMR systems. I want them to have tools they can trust and rely on. I want them to have tools they enjoy using. I want to give Doctors more face time with patients, and less screen time with the computer.

## How
By anticipating the needs of the medical field and using a web based SaaS approach, a dynamic, continuously developed EMR system can be created to meet the needs of a hospital and it's staff. More features may be added and developed by actively soliciting and critically reviewing feedback from the staff.

## Contributions
If you feel as I feel about EMR systems, and believe you can make a contribution to better further this project, please fork a branch, and reach out to me. I'd love the help.
